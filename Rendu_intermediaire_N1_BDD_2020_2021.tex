\subsection{Les hypothèses non trivialles.}
Puisque notre "schéma entité-association devra être accompagné d’un court texte justifiant les éventuels choix ou hypothèses que [nous avons] été amenés à faire", nous ne signalerons que les hypothèses non trivialles.

Les cardinalités minimale et maximale non expliquées, se basent sur le vocabulaire utilisé par le client dans le cahier des charges. Qui sont, pour rappel succint, "pour tous", "chaque", "peut", "parfois", "toujours" ... 



remplacer à la fin pour le propre
card min -> cardinalité minimum
card max -> cardinalité maximum
NNN -> Nous avons choisit 




NNN que la table spécialité comprend toutes les spécialités, tous domaines confondus, id est principale et secondaire. Ainsi : 
0N interprète, card min 0 car "parfois" possible qu'interprète n'ai pas de spécialité secondaire,
card maxi N car plusieurs
0N spécialité, card 0 min car toutes les spécialités secondaires ne sont pas présentes, certaines ne sont que des principales (table contient toutes spé, certaines ne sont que des ppal, donc pas prises pour secondaires), 
card N maxi car "ses spécialités secondaires".
